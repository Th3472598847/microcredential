         <p class="p1q">Queens is the easternmost and largest in area of the five boroughs of New York City,

            Queens is one of the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world, 
            as residents often closely identify with their neighborhood rather than with the borough or city. 
            The borough is a patchwork of dozens of unique neighborhoods, 
            each with its own distinct identity.</p>
